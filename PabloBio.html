            <p>
              You know me, I'm big P. I'm better than Andrew at Smash. I don't have much more to say.
              <br><br>
              I want to be the very best,
              Like no one ever was.
              To catch them is my real test,
              To train them is my cause!
              I will travel across the land,
              Searching far and wide.
              Each Pokemon to understand
              The power that's inside!
              <br><br>
              Every challenge along the way,
              With courage I will face!
              I will battle every day,
              To claim my rightful place!
              Come with me, the time is right,
              There's no better team!
              Arm in arm, we'll win the fight,
              It's always been our dream!
            </p>
